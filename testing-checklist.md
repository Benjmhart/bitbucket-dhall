## Testing

currently we have tests/examples written for the following cases:
default script
branch script on master

...only using simple Sequential steps

we will require the following tests to really call this production ready: 

- Parallel steps
- Step w/ caches
- step with seperate images
- step with after-script
- step with deployment (heroku?)
- full config with clone options
- full config with tags pipelines
- full config with bookmarks pipelines
- full config with pull requests
- full config with custom setup/variables
- a proper test runner
